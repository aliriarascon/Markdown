# Indications

### Inability to maintain adequate ventilation

* Ventilation – ability to remove CO2 from lungs
* High PaCO2 – hypoventilation
* Low PaCO2 - hyperventilation

### Inability to maintain adequated oxygenation

* Hypercarbia and hypoxemia frequently occur together when failure of ventilation leads to or co-occurs with failure of oxygenation
* Hypoxemia with low to normal CO2
* PaO2 cannot be maintained >50 mmHg by increasing FiO2

### Work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

* Ventilation is inefficient and/or exhausting
* Increased RR due to poor lung compliance
* Decreased vital capacity

I feel like this needs a heading??? not sure what the goal is with this content?
Isolate and protect the airway.

Relieve airway obstruction 

Facilitate suctioning of the tracheobronchial tree.

# Question 1
Hypoventilation can cause which condition?

[RIGHT] High PaCO2 
[WRONG] Low PaCO2 

# Question 2
Hyperventilation can cause which condition?

[RIGHT] Low PaCO2
[WRONG] High PaCO2

# Question 3
Which findings best indicate that the work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain?

[RIGHT] RR= 33, HR= 130, BP= 150/100, diaphoresis
[WRONG] RR= 25, HR= 40, BP= 100/50, hypothermia
(I changed this to be a little less obvious/higher level)

# Question 4
Which of the following is an indication for mechanical ventilation?

[WRONG] Provide fluids to the lungs
[WRONG] Remove pericardial fluid
[RIGHT] Isolate and protect the airway

# Question 5
What does decreased vital capacity indicate?

[WRONG] The patient has decreased cardiac output
[WRONG] The patient has adequate breathing ability
[RIGHT] The work of breathing is greater than the patient can maintain

# Question 6
Which of the following is not an indication for mechanical ventilation?

[RIGHT] Myocardial infarction (MI)
[WRONG] Respiratory failure
[WRONG] Provide ventilatory support after chest trauma or surgery
[WRONG] Brain injury requiring a barbituate-induced coma
